		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			The project is called “Got Sandwich?” — this title is inspired by the advertising campaign “Got Milk?”. The basic mechanics of the game is very similar and straight forward to the famous game Overcooked! The player is asked to complete orders generated randomly on the screen and compile all the ingredients to make sandwiches as desired.

			Basic mechanics of the game involves moving around the avatar (W-up, A-left, S-down, D-right); preparing the food — C to chop, P to pick up, O to drop or put together the sandwich, F to serve the food; throwing away the failed product to the trash bin by simply dropping it it. The player must pay attention to the time limit as well as the customer’s needs to be able to succeed. Difficulties of the game reside in the randomness of the order and the preparation process of chopping and assembling in designated spaces.

			Two things to be noted are also listed in the instruction: first, they must serve the right order to receive points for the sandwich; second, they must chop the food on the counter of the kitchen for their own safety. All ingredients must be chopped before they could be actually put inside the sandwich and served to the customer.

			For each round, players are given two minutes to make as many sandwiches as they can. On the top left corner, there is the order receipt which indicates what types of sandwiches the customer is currently looking for. Only by serving the sandwich that is asked by the customer can the player score the points. The countdown timer as well as the points scored are also listed in the middle of the screen, reminding the player of the time left. If at any point during the game the player wants to stop, they could click the “pause” caption on the top right corner of the screen to enter the pause page. The page allows them to return back to the game whenever they are ready, and they could rest as long as they want to.
